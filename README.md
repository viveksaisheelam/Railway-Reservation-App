# Railway-Reservation-App
This project involves creating a Railway Reservation Application using Java for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end database. The app provides a user-friendly graphical interface to search for trains, check availability, and make reservations.
Key Features:
User Interface (UI): Developed using Java Swing, the UI includes forms for entering travel details (starting station, destination, travel date, number of passengers) and displays the results in a neat and organized manner.
Database Management: MySQL database stores information about trains, stations, and reservations. It ensures data consistency and quick retrieval of information.
Search Functionality: Users can search for available trains based on their starting point and destination. The app fetches relevant train schedules from the database.
Reservation System: Allows users to make reservations by selecting a train from the search results. The system checks for seat availability before confirming the booking.
Technologies Used:
Java: For creating the application logic and user interface.
Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
MySQL: For storing and managing train and reservation data.
JDBC: For connecting the Java application with the MySQL database.
This application provides a seamless experience for users to book railway tickets efficiently, leveraging robust backend support and an intuitive front-end interface.
